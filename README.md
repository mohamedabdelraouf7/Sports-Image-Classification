# üèãÔ∏è Sports Image Classification Using CNN

This project is a deep learning application developed as part of the **CSE381 - Introduction to Machine Learning** course at Future University in Egypt. The goal is to classify images of various sports activities using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## üéØ Problem Statement

The dataset consists of sports images categorized into different classes (e.g., Badminton, Cricket). The task is to build a multi-class image classifier using CNNs that generalizes well across unseen test data.

- **Training Set**: 8,227 labeled images  
- **Test Set**: 2,056 unlabeled images (for prediction)  
- **Task**: Multi-class classification with robustness to image quality, lighting, and perspective variations.
